    My name is Cristian Camilo Cuervo Castillo, I am 23 years old, (when this page was created), I was born in Bogot√° on December 29, 1996, I am a creative, innovative, critical, ethical, recursive, responsible and proactive person. All my life I have been interested in technology, which led me to study a career related to it, always insisting on learning and concentrating on improving myself. And somehow always in awe of what technology brings us, like most young people I was influenced by games, and the first thing I developed right after learning basic programming skills was a game.    </p>
